## Usage Notes

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. The icon pack name, originally **Payment Logos**, was changed to **Payment**.
> 2. The suffixes of icons were adjusted from `-alt` to `-N`, where `N` represents a number, until a unique icon name was found.
> 3. The **Payment** font is standalone and has its own [codepoints](https://github.com/iconicFonts/if/blob/main/indices/Payment.csv), which are different from those in the [IF](https://github.com/iconicFonts/if/blob/main/indices/if.csv) font[^1].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [codepoints](https://github.com/iconicFonts/if/blob/main/indices/Payment.csv) for the **Payment** font remain unchanged and will not alter in the future, ensuring that you can use the font safely even when new versions are released.

## Support

If you've found this project helpful, a little love goes a long way. Give it a :star: or share it around.

[^1]: The first glyph for the **Payment** font starts from codepoint `E000`, while for the [IF](https://github.com/iconicFonts/if/blob/main/indices/if.csv) font, it starts from `F53CD`.
